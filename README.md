# Restore a previous scroll position that was saved earlier

This project requires a little (lot!) more work to make it obvious to anybody else what is going on. I finally found this again after looking for it all over my computer.


## IMPORTANT: This worked on stackblitz, but not when I put on my local computer to use with Angular 9. Weird!

See the stackblitz version here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/a5465
